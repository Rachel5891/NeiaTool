<h1>NEIA Pilot Study - Informed Consent</h1>

<div class="consent-box">
  <h2>Purpose of the Study</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of a newly developed instrument designed to validate NCLEX questions. This will involve comparing your assessment scores with those generated by a custom artificial intelligence (AI) scoring model.</p>

  <h2>What Does the Study Involve?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the instrument to assess a set of NCLEX questions.</li>
    <li>Provide scores based on the criteria outlined in the instrument.</li>
    <li>Allow your scores to be compared to those generated by our custom AI model to assess the instrument's reliability and validity.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Your participation is voluntary, and you may withdraw at any point. There may be no direct benefit to you from participating in this study; however, your contributions will be valuable in enhancing the validity and reliability of an instrument for nursing education and assessment.</p>

  <h2>Confidentiality & Risks</h2>
  <p>There are minimal risks, including the loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to maintain confidentiality. Your de-identified information may be shared with other researchers without your additional informed consent.</p>

  <h2>Contact Information</h2>
  <p>The Principal Investigator (PI) of this project is <strong>Dr. Anshul Kumar</strong>. He can be reached at <a href="mailto:akumar@mghihp.edu">akumar@mghihp.edu</a>.</p>
  <p>The co-investigator is <strong>Dr. Rachel Cox Simms</strong>. She can be reached at <a href="mailto:rlcox@mghihp.edu">rlcox@mghihp.edu</a>.</p>

  <h2>Agreement to Participate</h2>
  <p>Your completion of the online survey will be considered your informed consent to participate in the study.</p>

  <p><strong>Upon clicking "Submit," you will receive links to 5 randomly selected NCLEX questions. If you do not finish all 5 in one sitting, you can return using the same link as long as you do not clear your browser cache.</strong></p>
